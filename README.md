This Program is a Minesweeper Game I created with help from a tutorial (https://youtu.be/MCS1hSBLJcY). The point of this project was for me to get familliar with Java's Swing GUI so I can create solo projects later on with it. 

Whilst I used a tutorial for quite a bit of this program, I also added on some other features such as allowing the user to choose how many bombs they wished to use.
